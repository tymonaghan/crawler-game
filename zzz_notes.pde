/*

loadout screen is messed up right now, it's running on weaponNumber being the same as weaponSlot, which is not the case anymore

radio button doesn't work correctly if you skip straight to battleinit, but this is fine

something is not working correctly with the enemy's turn, can't reach the enemy.drawTurnReport() function
